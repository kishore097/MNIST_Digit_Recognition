# MNIST DIGIT RECOGNITION

Recognition using Deep Networks PyTorch

The aim of this project is to build, train, analyse and modify a deep network for digit recognition using MNIST dataset. Additionally, We also examined the network by analysing the different layers and seeing their effect on the images. We then used this trained model to identify the greek symbols alpha, beta, gamma by using the digit network as a digital embedding space. We experimented with various different dimensions that would affect the performance of the model and optimised it. 

Operating System - Linux(Ubuntu)
